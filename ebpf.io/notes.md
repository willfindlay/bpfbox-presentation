# 30 Second Teaser

I'm William Findlay, from Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I'll
be presenting bpfbox, a new process confinement mechanism for Linux implemented
using eBPF and KRSI. bpfbox leverages multiple BPF program types to allow
user-defined policy to integrate with both userspace and kernelspace system
state while enforcing policy with BPF LSM probes.
